# Strings - Text Processing Mastery

## Why Strings are Important in DSA
Strings are sequences of characters and appear in countless programming problems:
- Text processing and manipulation
- Pattern matching and searching
- Parsing and validation
- Data format conversion
- Many LeetCode problems involve strings

## What You'll Learn
1. **String Fundamentals**: Immutability, common operations
2. **String Algorithms**: Pattern matching, manipulation
3. **Character Operations**: ASCII values, case conversion
4. **StringBuilder**: Efficient string building
5. **String Problems**: Common interview patterns

## Key Concepts
- **Immutability**: Strings cannot be changed after creation
- **String Pool**: Java optimizes string storage
- **StringBuilder**: Mutable alternative for building strings
- **Character Arrays**: Sometimes more efficient than strings
