# Linked Lists - Dynamic Data Structures

## Why Linked Lists Matter
Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically. They're fundamental to understanding:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Pointer/reference manipulation
- Building blocks for other data structures (stacks, queues, trees)
- Many interview algorithms

## What You'll Learn
1. **Singly Linked Lists**: Basic structure and operations
2. **Doubly Linked Lists**: Two-way navigation
3. **Circular Linked Lists**: Last node points to first
4. **Common Operations**: Insert, delete, search, reverse
5. **LeetCode Problems**: Real interview questions

## Key Concepts
- **Node Structure**: Data + reference to next node
- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow/shrink during runtime
- **Sequential Access**: Must traverse from head to reach elements
- **Memory Efficient**: Only allocates memory when needed

## Time Complexity
- **Access**: O(n) - must traverse from head
- **Search**: O(n) - linear search only
- **Insert**: O(1) at head, O(n) at specific position
- **Delete**: O(1) if node reference known, O(n) to find node
