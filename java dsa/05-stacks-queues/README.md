# Stacks and Queues - LIFO and FIFO Data Structures

## Why Stacks and Queues Matter
These are fundamental data structures with specific access patterns:
- **Stack**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) - like a stack of plates
- **Queue**: First In, First Out (FIFO) - like a line of people
- Used in algorithms, system design, and many real-world applications

## What You'll Learn
1. **Stack Implementation**: Array-based and linked list-based
2. **Queue Implementation**: Array-based and linked list-based  
3. **Applications**: Expression evaluation, BFS, DFS, function calls
4. **Advanced Variants**: Deque, circular queue, priority queue
5. **LeetCode Problems**: Stack and queue interview questions

## Key Applications

### Stack Applications:
- Function call management (call stack)
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing
- Undo operations in software
- Browser back button functionality
- Depth-First Search (DFS) in graphs

### Queue Applications:
- Process scheduling in operating systems
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs
- Handling requests in web servers
- Print job management
- Level-order tree traversal

## Time Complexity
- **Stack**: Push O(1), Pop O(1), Peek O(1)
- **Queue**: Enqueue O(1), Dequeue O(1), Front O(1)
