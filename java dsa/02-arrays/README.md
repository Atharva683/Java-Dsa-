# Arrays - The Foundation of Data Structures

## Why Arrays are Crucial for DSA
Arrays are the building blocks of most data structures and algorithms. Master arrays, and you'll understand:
- How memory works in programming
- Index-based access patterns
- The foundation for strings, lists, stacks, queues, and more
- Most sorting and searching algorithms

## What You'll Learn
1. **Array Fundamentals**: Declaration, initialization, access
2. **Common Operations**: Insert, delete, search, update
3. **Array Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, two pointers
4. **Problem Patterns**: Sliding window, prefix sums, etc.
5. **LeetCode-style Problems**: Real interview questions

## Key Concepts
- **Time Complexity**: Access O(1), Search O(n), Insert/Delete O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for n elements
- **Fixed Size**: Cannot change size after creation
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements stored in consecutive memory locations
