## Why These Basics Matter for DSA
Before diving into data structures, you need to be comfortable with:
1. **Variables & Data Types**: Essential for storing and manipulating data
2. **Arrays**: The foundation of most data structures
3. **Methods**: Breaking down problems into smaller functions
4. **Loops**: Traversing data structures
5. **Conditionals**: Making decisions in algorithms
